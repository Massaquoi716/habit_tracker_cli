class AnalyticsService:
    """
    A service class for computing habit analytics using functional programming principles.
    This class provides static methods to calculate streaks (longest and current) for habits
    based on their completion timestamps, supporting both daily and weekly periodicities.
    All methods are stateless and immutable, adhering to functional programming paradigms.

    Attributes:
        None (static methods only, no class-level state).

    Usage:
        - Import and call static methods with appropriate habit data (e.g., timestamps, periodicity).
        - Designed to work with BaseHabit instances from src.data_model.habit.
